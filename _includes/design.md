- Uses GitLab salt-formulas to configure the server. One GitLab instance will be deployed, configured with a Postfix server.
- For access to GitLab server, a floating IP address will be assigned to the salt-master. Additionally, GitLab is on a separate network so that applications can access your GitLab server without being on the same network.
- Changes to the GitLab configuration can be done using Salt pillars on the Salt master.
