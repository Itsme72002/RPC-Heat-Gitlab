GitLab Community Edition (GitLab CE) is open source web-based Git repository
manager with wiki and issue tracking features. GitLab's wiki is also stored in
git. GitLab provides a web dashboard with web file browser, filters, activity
feeds, and continuous integration features. It also supports such everyday
tasks as unified and side-by-side diffs, merge requests for code reviews, line
specific comments, and more. Postfix is used for sending email, and email
notifications can be setup at a user or global level. Unique permission levels
can be configured per user and project (guest, reporter, developer, master,
owner). GitLab provides Http(s) and ssh git access. Users can be authenticated
using LDAP. GitLab also provides adminstrative interface for setting up users
and permissions.
